# Git MCP Server Log Analysis

## Log Sample (2025-02-20)

```log
2025-02-20T04:22:33.935Z [mcp-server-git] [info] Server transport closed
2025-02-20T04:22:33.935Z [mcp-server-git] [info] Client transport closed
2025-02-20T04:22:33.935Z [mcp-server-git] [info] Server transport closed unexpectedly, this is likely due to the process exiting early. If you are developing this MCP server you can add output to stderr (i.e. `console.error('...')` in JavaScript, `print('...', file=sys.stderr)` in python) and it will appear in this log.
2025-02-20T04:22:33.935Z [mcp-server-git] [error] Server disconnected. For troubleshooting guidance, please visit our [debugging documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging) {"context":"connection"}

## Analysis

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Package Name Error**
   - The system is trying to install `mcp-server-git` but this package doesn't exist
   - Error: `npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/mcp-server-git - Not found`
   - This indicates an incorrect package name is being used

2. **Server Transport Closure**
   - Log: `Server transport closed unexpectedly, this is likely due to the process exiting early`
   - This suggests the server process is terminating before it can properly initialize
   - The error is likely a direct result of the package not being found

3. **Connection Context Error**
   - Log: `Server disconnected. {"context":"connection"}`
   - This confirms the issue is related to connection establishment rather than authentication

### Timeline Analysis

The log shows a clear sequence:
1. Attempt to connect to server (04:22:33.935Z)
2. Server process failure (immediate)
3. npm package registry error (404)
4. Second connection attempt (04:22:34.007Z)
5. Same failure pattern repeats

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Check npm debug log at: `/Users/Roger/.npm/_logs/2025-02-20T04_22_32_357Z-debug-0.log`
2. Verify correct package name: `@modelcontextprotocol/git-server`
3. Ensure npm registry access is working properly
4. Try installation with verbose logging: `npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/git-server --verbose`
